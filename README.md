The dataset has 39209 images for training and 12631 images for training. Out of the training set, 20% of the images are used for validation. <br />
The dataset has 43 different road signs/ marks with different ranges of sizes for each sign. <br />

Traffic Sign Classifier has an accuracy of around 95%. The images with very low resolution tend to give inaccurate results. But, the performance is excellent for the images with good resolution.<br />
